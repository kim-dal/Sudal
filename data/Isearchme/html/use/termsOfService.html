						<h4><strong>6. Use of the Service</strong></h4>
						iSearchme is a service that provides genetic traits (“Traits”) analysis, which allow you to learn more about your genome. It helps you interpret genomic data from consumer genomics companies. <br>
						The analysis will consist of multiple categories including physical characteristics, intelligence, nutrition, fitness, personality, and lifestyle. Please note that with respect to these characteristics, the Service provides you with a prediction based on currently available literature, not a guarantee of a particular result<br><br>
						In order to analyze your relevant Traits and provide you an analysis, <br><br>
						(i) You need to create your account on the Service. By registering an account on the Service, you warrant that you are eligible to use the Service pursuant to Section 3 of these Terms of Service and that all account information you provide to us is your own information and is truthful and accurate. You understand and agree that we may immediately suspend or terminate your account if we have any reason to believe that you have misrepresented or provided false account information to us. It is your responsibility to keep your account information accurate and current. As the account holder, you are responsible for safeguarding your account login information (username and password), and you should notify us immediately in the event your account login is lost, stolen, or used by another without your permission. You are responsible for all activities on your account, including activities by anyone whom you allow to access your account.<br><br>
						(ii) You need to submit a properly completed and signed consent form (<b><a href="termsofConsent.html" target="_blank" title="새창">“Terms of Consent”</a></b>) to us.<br><br>
						(iii) We need to collect your raw genetic data (“Raw Data”) that are obtained from one of three consumer genomics companies. (23andMe, Ancestry.com, MyHeritage). We have no relationship with any of the three, nor do we recommend or criticize them or any of them. We limit our work to data from these three companies. You can submit your Raw Data by uploading it on the Service. If you upload the Raw Data of another person and let us analyze those data, you warrant that: (a) you either have legal authority to do so (e.g., you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 18 whose Raw Data you are submitting and are allowing us to collect and analyze his or her Raw Data), or have obtained authorization from such person to allow us to collect and analyze Raw Data about him/her; and (b) you are not an insurance company or an employer attempting to obtain information about an insured person or an employee. If you let us collect and analyze Raw Data about another person, you are representing to us that you are authorized to submit the Terms of Consent and a questionnaire relating to health and lifestyle (“Questionnaire”) for and on behalf of that person.<br>
						If you upload Raw Data to the Service from outside the United States, you warrant that doing so does not violate any law or regulation in the country or jurisdiction in which you reside, and you expressly authorize and consent to our collecting and analyzing, in the United States, such uploaded Raw Data and 1.) all resulting genetic information, such as  any findings from the analysis and future studies; and 2.) all associated predispositions to traits, derived from the genetic information.<br><br>
						(iv) We will use advanced genetic tools to analyze your data and provide you an analysis. We may ask you to fill out the Questionnaire so we can learn more about the genetic basis of different traits. <br><br>
						The results of the Traits analysis are accessible only through the Service.
						
						<h4><strong>7. Prohibited Uses</strong></h4>
						You may use the Service only for lawful and noncommercial purposes and in accordance with Terms. You agree <b>not</b> to: <br><br>
						(a)	use the Service to promote discrimination, violence, or hate towards groups or individuals based on race, color, religion, ethnicity, family heritage, sex, national origin, age, income, or health data;<br><br>
						(b)	use the Service to violate the privacy of another person, including without limitation: impersonating another person, or creating an account on the Service in the name of another person, or submitting another person’s Raw Data to the Service without valid authorization or legal authority;<br><br>
						(c)	use the Service for any illegal activity;<br><br>
						(d) use the Service for any commercial activity;<br><br>

						<h4><strong>8. Risks</strong></h4>
						While there are no physical risks from using the Service, there may be information risks.<br><br>
						The Service will provide you with information about you. You might learn unexpected findings about yourself or your family. Once you know your genetic information, the knowledge is irreversible. For some, the information is empowering; for others, the findings may cause anxiety and discomfort. Also, the information you receive may not be positive and may be upsetting to you or to others with whom you choose to share the information. In some cases, it may disrupt longstanding and valued interpersonal relationships. In others, it may help you form new relationships. If you elect to upload your Raw Data, you do so at your own risk. If the possibility of some adverse effect from sharing your information is unacceptable, it is probably best if you exercise your right to maintain confidential the information the Service provides you.
						
						<h4><strong>9.	Important Disclaimers</strong></h4>

						The Service is provided as-is. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of the algorithms the Service employs. Moreover, as the analysis is based on your Raw Data, that you obtained from other companies, inaccuracies in your Raw Data may affect your results. <br><br>
						You agree that all claims must be brought in each party's individual capacity and not as a representative plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. By creating an account, using the Service, or uploading Raw Data, you agree to waive the right to bring or participate in a class action claim.<br><br>
