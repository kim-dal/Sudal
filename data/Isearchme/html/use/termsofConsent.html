						Before your data are uploaded to iSearchme, you must agree to the consent terms. iSearchme is the name of the service offering of ichrogene USA, Inc. (“ichrogene”).<br>
						Please review this form carefully. If you agree to allow ichrogene to access and use your data to provide iSearchme service as described herein and in our <a href="termsOfService.html" target="_blank" title="새창">Terms of Service</a> and<a href="privacyPolicy.html" target="_blank" title="새창"> Privacy Policy</a>, click the “I AGREE” button at the bottom of the page. You must be 18 years or older to be eligible to use the Service.
						<br>Remember, you are free to withdraw your consent and to discontinue participation at any time. Your participation is entirely voluntary.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Purpose</strong><br>
						iSearchme is a personal genetic testing and analysis service provided by ichrogene USA Inc. The goal of the service is to help you interpret your genomic data from other consumer genomics companies so you can learn more about your genetics and be better able to make healthier lifestyle choices to improve your health and wellness.<br>
						ichrogene is not a medical practice or other healthcare service and iSearchme is not for diagnosis or treatment of disease in yourself or others. We are not physicians and we do not provide medical diagnoses, advice, recommendations, or treatment. If you have any concerns about a disease or medical condition, you must discuss your concerns with a healthcare provider.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Procedures</strong><br>
						To use iSearchme, after providing your consent, you must create your account and upload your Raw Genetic Data from one of the following consumer genetics service: 23andMe, MyHeritage, AncestryDNA, or ichrogene. ichrogene neither endorses nor criticizes the services offered by these companies; rather, ichrogene simply helps you better understand your raw genetic sequence. As used, here, “Raw Genetic Data” means the information about your genes that you are provided by one of these three services.<br>
						Your “raw” genetic sequence means the order of the bases in your genes, which will be the base for your genetic analysis. To use iSearchme, you must have your Raw Genetic Data from one of the consumer genetic services mentioned above. For more details, please visit our FAQ page.<br>
						Once you upload your Raw Genetic Data, iSearchme will analyze your sequence and will provide you with our analysis of the results. Our analysis will help you understand the genetic basis of your genetic traits as they relate to fitness, nutrition, cognitive ability, and many other health-related subjects.<br>
						We may ask you to fill out questionnaires relating to your health, lifestyle and family tree, as this information will help us provide you more insight into the genetic bases of your traits. The questionnaires are self-reported and completely voluntary.<br>
						We reserve the right to offer you additional services in the future or to discontinue the service at our sole discretion.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Privacy</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Our scientists will have access to your results to provide our service to you and to answer your questions.
							</li>
							<li>Otherwise, only you and anyone to whom you give access to your account will have access to your analysis.</li>
							<li>As described in our <a href="privacyPolicy.html" target="_blank" title="새창">Privacy Policy</a>, we may share aggregated data with other researchers or entities. Your de-identified results will be used for calculating average data only, and will be mixed with a large number of other anonymous genomes before sharing. Aggregated data cannot be used to identify you, as it will not include your personal information such as name, e-mail address, or any other identifiers. </li>
							<li>We may release personal information if required to do so by state or federal law, or to respond to a court order, subpoena, law enforcement, regulatory request, search warrant, or the like.
							</li>
							<li>In the event that ichrogene USA Inc. or a substantial part of its assets or stock is acquired, transferred, or sold, you understand and agree that your Personal Data can be transferred, licensed, assigned, and/or transmitted to another party under the condition that, for at least 180 days following the date of the acquisition or transfer, the acquiring party will offer you the option to delete your Personal Data.</li>
						</ul>
						
						Please review our <a href="privacyPolicy.html" target="_blank" title="새창">Privacy Policy</a> for more details on how we handle your personal information.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Risks</strong><br>
						The Service will provide you with information about you. You might learn unexpected findings about yourself or your family. Once you know your genetic information, the knowledge is irreversible. For some, the information is empowering; for others, the findings may cause anxiety and discomfort. Also, the information you receive may not be positive and may be upsetting to you or to others with whom you choose to share the information. In some cases, it may disrupt longstanding and valued interpersonal relationships. In others, it may help you form new relationships. Except as stated above, the Service will not share your data with anyone. If you elect to do so, you acknowledge and accept the risk that sharing your information with others creates the risks discussed here. The Service cannot and will not accept responsibility for any consequences of your decision to disclose your personal information to anyone else. If the possibility of some adverse effect from sharing your information is unacceptable, it is probably best if you exercise your right to maintain confidential the information the Service provides you.<br>
						Despite our efforts to protect the information you provide us; we cannot guarantee that your identity or genetic information will never become known. The risk for such a confidentiality breach is very low but not zero. Despite our security precautions, for examples, hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to your data. Also, as stated above, we may need to share your information with law enforcement and regulators if we are required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities. Please see our <a href="privacyPolicy.html" target="_blank" title="새창">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Limitations</strong><br>
						Your raw genetic data and its analysis cannot tell you everything about you. The analysis and results describe your probability of having certain traits. Your DNA is only a part of what makes you who you are. In many cases, the environment in which you were raised, the education and experiences you have had, and the lifestyle choices you make may influence you more than your genetics. Thus, the analysis and reports we provide are not deterministic. If on the basis of information you learn by using the Service you think some significant change in your habits, exercise, diet, lifestyle, medications, or healthcare may be warranted, you should confer with your healthcare professional before making any such change. The Service cannot accept and will deny liability for any change you elect to make without having first sought advice from a competent healthcare professional.<br>
						It is possible that your raw genetic data contain errors, as errors can occur when a 3rd party consumer genetics company gathers, sequences, and provides you the data. Because your raw genetic data were not collected and sequenced by us, we will not be able to identify the errors if your data contain any.<br>
						You understand and agree that iSearchme service is provided solely for your convenience, and you accept our services at your own risk. ichrogene USA Inc. shall have no liability to you for errors in your raw genetic data, or for the consequences of your decision to disclose your results to any other person.<br>
						You agree that all claims must be brought in each party’s individual capacity and not as a representative plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. By creating an account, using iSearchme, or uploading your raw genetic data, you agree to waive the right to participate in a class action claim.<br>
