						<h4><strong>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</strong></h4>
						CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/<br><br>
						According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:<br><br>
						(a) users can visit our site anonymously;<br><br>
						(b) our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of our website;<br><br>
						(c) users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;<br><br>
						(d) users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@ichrogene.com.<br><br>
						Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:<br><br>
						We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.<br><br>
						You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.<br><br>
